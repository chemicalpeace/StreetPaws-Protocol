# 🐾 StreetPaws Protocol (SPP)

### *DePin for Street Animal Welfare*

## 🌍 The Vision
StreetPaws Protocol is the world's first **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePin)** for street animal care. By combining **IoT Smart Feeders**, **AI-driven Health Monitoring**, and **Blockchain Incentives**, we turn every act of kindness into a verifiable, rewarded transaction.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Proof-of-Care (PoC)**: Upload photos of feeding/vet visits. AI verifies the action and geolocation.
- **Smart Feeder Network**: IoT-enabled feeders release food automatically when funded via crypto smart contracts.
- **PawsDAO**: Community-governed fund for emergency vet bills.
- **Tokenomics**: Earn $PAWS tokens for verified care actions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Mobile**: React Native (Expo)
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum / Polygon (Solidity)
- **AI**: Python (TensorFlow for image recognition)
- **IoT**: ESP32 / Raspberry Pi

## 📅 Roadmap
- [ ] Phase 1: Mobile App MVP (User Verification)
- [ ] Phase 2: Smart Contract Deployment
- [ ] Phase 3: Hardware Feeder Prototype
